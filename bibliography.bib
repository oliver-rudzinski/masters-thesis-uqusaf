	abstract = {While researchers have developed many tools, techniques, and protocols for improving software security, exploits and breaches are only becoming more frequent. Some of this gap between theoretical security and actual vulnerability can be explained by insufficient consideration of human factors, broadly termed usability, when developing these mechanisms. In particular, security mechanisms may be difficult to use, may conflict with other priorities, or may assume more security knowledge than users possess. For almost 20 years, the usable security community has investigated how to improve the usability of security tools and interfaces aimed at end users. More recently, the community has begun to apply similar techniques in the context of improving security tools - such as APIs and bug-finding software - aimed not at end users but at developers, whose security errors are magnified across all users of their products. In this paper, we review key lessons learned from usable security for end users and consider how to apply them in the context of developers. We propose a research agenda aimed at developing a high-quality, comprehensive literature for usable security for developers, including: investigating how to conduct reliable research in this context, understanding developers' attitudes, knowledge, and priorities, measuring the status quo, and developing improved tools and interventions in the future.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing number of easy-to-use cloud services to store and share information with others. Facebook, Dropbox, iCloud, Googlemail, Amazon S3, Windows SkyDrive and similar services encourage users to entrust the companies' servers with a large variety of information: from their holiday pictures to corporate documents. However, both private and corporate users commonly fail to take account of possible privacy consequences. Even though there are approaches to provide confidentiality for the users' data in the cloud, these are not widely adopted due to both awareness and usability issues. Therefore, we propose the novel Confidentiality as a Service (CaaS) paradigm to provide usable confidentiality and integrity for the bulk of users, for whom the current security mechanisms are too complex or require too much effort. The CaaS paradigm combines data security with usability by design and integrates effortlessly into available cloud service applications and workflows. We leverage the splitting of trust between the cloud service provider and one or more CaaS providers to improve usability. CaaS focuses on unobtrusive confidentiality by hiding all cryptographic artefacts from the prevalently non-technical users. Data protection is based on symmetric encryption and invisible key-management mechanisms. We present an integration for multiple popular cloud services to demonstrate the seamless applicability of CaaS.},

In most organisations, IT security managers decide on security policies and mechanisms, seemingly without considering usability. IT security managers consider risk reduction and the business impact of information security controls, but not the impact that controls have on users. Rather than trying to remind security managers of usability, we present a new paradigm -- a stealth approach which incorporates the impact of security controls on users' productivity and willingness to comply into business impact and risk reduction. During two 2-hour sessions, 3 IT security managers discussed with us mock-up tool prototypes that embody these principles, alongside a range of potential usage scenarios (e.g. cloud-based password-cracking attacks and "hot-desking" initiatives). Our tool design process elicits findings to help develop mechanisms to visualise these tradeoffs.},

In this paper, we present a user-centered model for usable security and privacy that is aligned with user-centered design guidelines [34] and the Human-Centered Design process [28]. Based on this model, we present an initial method for the design of usable security systems. Through active involvement of the user, the model and the method are meant to help developers to identify and solve shortcomings of their security and privacy mechanisms. We motivate our work and present our results based on an Internet of Things/smart home scenario. Due to the amount of private data and strong data protection laws, both usability and privacy are of major importance in this domain. However, our model and method are not limited to the smart home domain, but can be applied whenever usable security and privacy are of particular interest for a system under development.},

The effort to improve the security posture of the human element of financial services systems has not matched the effort in developing technical countermeasures, thereby undoing the gains of the later. One area where such problem exist is in Fintech where emphasis is placed on developing innovative and secured technical financial models aimed at making financial services more accessible through the mobile phone. These Fintech solutions however have shortcomings in securing the human element. This study seeks to address this problem through the development of heuristics that can be applied in the evaluation or design of Usable Security in Fintech. This study developed twelve (12) initial Usable Security heuristics which were validated through expert review. The heuristics were developed through an iterative approach that comprises a survey of Fintech users, semi-structured interviews of Fintech solution providers and thematic analysis of relevant literature. The findings of the study show that application of the developed heuristic provides for Usable Security. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These activities can then be combined with those described in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations; SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk; and other guidelines to form a comprehensive risk-based approach for security and privacy.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, research has shown that both technical solutions and user perceptions are important to improve security and privacy in the digital realm. The ﬁeld of ‘usable security’ already started to emerge in the mid-90s, primarily focussed on password and email security. Later on, the research ﬁeld of ”usable security and privacy” evolved and broadened the aim to design concepts and tools to assist users in enhancing their behaviour with regard to both privacy and security. Nevertheless, many user interventions are not as eﬀective as desired. Because of highly diverse usage contexts, leading to diﬀerent privacy and security requirements and not always to one-size-ﬁts-all approaches, tailorability is necessary to address this issue. Furthermore, transparency is a crucial requirement, as providing comprehensible information may counter reactance towards security interventions. This article ﬁrst provides a brief history of the research ﬁeld in its ﬁrst quarter-century and then highlights research on the transparency and tailorability of user interventions. Based on this, this article then presents six contributions with regard to (1) privacy concerns in times of COVID-19, (2) authentication on mobile devices, (3) GDPR-compliant data management, (4) privacy notices on websites, (5) data disclosure scenarios in agriculture, as well as (6) rights under data protection law and the concrete process should data subjects want to claim those rights. This article concludes with several research directions on user-centred transparency and tailorability.},

The main features of cloud computing is that the user does not have any setup of expensive computing infrastructure and the cost of its services is less. In the recent years, cloud computing integrates with the industry and many other areas, which has been encouraging the researcher to research on new related technologies. Due to the availability of its services \& scalability for computing processes individual users and organizations transfer their application, data and services to the cloud storage server. Regardless of its advantages, the transformation of local computing to remote computing has brought many security issues and challenges for both consumer and provider. Many cloud services are provided by the trusted third party which arises new security threats. The cloud provider provides its services through the Internet and uses many web technologies that arise new security issues. This paper discussed about the basic features of the cloud computing, security issues, threats and their solutions.

Recent studies have shown that over 70 percent of the world's businesses now operate at least some of their operations in the cloud, with many more expected to join in the coming years. In the past, security concerns deterred many organizations from using cloud computing services. In this paper a review of three critical cloud security threats is discussed, with the purpose of determining if the new widespread adoption of cloud computing is due to advances in security. The review revealed that although new security technologies have been introduced, many issues concerning the three threats are still present today. Because of this, continued widespread adoption of cloud computing will likely increase compromises until innovative techniques are created to address cloud computing threats.},

Cloud computing faces common security issues like data loss, malware attacks, phishing attacks, man in the middle attack etc., if proper care is not taken in hosting of applications and services. The technologies that make cloud computing possible like multi-tenancy, virtualization etc. itself can be exploited. Organizations often move to private cloud infrastructure in order to have better control over the data, infrastructure and security policies compared to the public cloud. Moving to a private cloud will not make the cloud more secured in nature. Security measures must be taken to make sure that the private cloud is secured.

	abstract = {The security gateway between an attacker and a user's private data is the Cloud Control Interface (CCI): If an attacker manages to get access to this interface, he controls the data. Several high-level data breaches originate here, the latest being the business failure of the British company Code Spaces. In such situations, using a private cloud is often claimed to be more secure than using a public cloud. In this paper, we show that this security assumption may not be justified: We attack private clouds through their rich, HTML5-based control interfaces, using well-known attacks on web interfaces (XSS, CSRF, and Clickjacking) combined with novel exploitation techniques for Infrastructure as a Service clouds. We analyzed four open-source projects for private IaaS cloud deployment (Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, OpenStack, and openQRM) in default configuration. We were able to compromise the security of three cloud installations (Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, and openQRM) One of our attacks (OpenNebula) allowed us to gain root access to VMs even if full perimeter security is enabled, i.e. if the cloud control interface is only reachable from a certain segment of the company's network, and if all network traffic is filtered through a firewall. We informed all projects about the attack vectors and proposed mitigations. As a general recommendation, we propose to make web management interfaces for private clouds inaccessible from the Internet, and to include this technical requirement in the definition of a private cloud.},

On the other hand, we could aggregate the evaluations from several evaluators to a single evaluation and such aggregates do rather well, even when they consist of only three to five people.},

Since then, these methods, analyses of their comparative effectiveness, and their use have evolved in different ways. In this paper, we track the fortunes of the methods and analyses, looking at which led to use and to further research, and which led to relative methodological dead ends. Heuristic evaluation and the cognitive walkthrough appear to be the most actively used and researched techniques. The pluralistic walkthrough remains a recognized technique, although not the subject of significant further study. Formal usability inspections appear to have been incorporated into other techniques or largely abandoned in practice. We conclude with lessons for practitioners and suggestions for future research.},

With a few exceptions, modern textbooks either entirely omit lists of principles or present only the 1975 list. Although such lists might provide useful, if incomplete, guidelines for practitioners, their principal value might be in teaching students the fundamental concepts of information security.},

Based on a literature review, we extracted 23 principles, 11 guidelines and 47 patterns for usable security and identified their interconnection. The results indicate that current research tends to focus on only a subset of important principles. The fact that some principles are not yet addressed by any design patterns suggests that further work on refining these patterns is needed. We developed an online repository, which stores the harmonized principles, guidelines and patterns. The tool enables users to search for relevant guidance and explore it in an interactive and programmatic manner. We argue that both the insights presented in this article and the web-based repository will be highly valuable for students to get a good overview, practitioners to implement usable security and researchers to identify areas of future research.},

In recent years, with the development of digital interfaces, a set of procedures, rules and usability standards have been developed to facilitate projecting processes and evaluation of interfaces to ensure a better user interaction. There are plenty of heuristics sets, created by authors, which serve as the basis for other researchers and professionals in the improvement and expansion of the joint heuristics. Thus, this research presents a study on the heuristics used for the assessment of human-computer interaction process (IHC), the contact of users with interfaces. The objective of the research is to identify the similiarities, singularities and equivalences between the concepts from the heuristics set available for evalution of interface.},
